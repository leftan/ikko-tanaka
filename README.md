## About

[Ikko Tanaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikko_Tanaka) is one of my most favorite graphic designers and I love those pictures very much.

This is the **second** time to create them with pure CSS after 4 years.
Although there are CSS grid and clip-path to use nowadays,
it's still challenging to make them responsive and deal the sub-pixel problem.

Cheers!
